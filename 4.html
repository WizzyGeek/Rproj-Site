                    One of Brazil's most iconic symbols, the Art Deco styled statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro is one of the seven
                    wonders of the world. The credit of building the statue goes to Paul Landowski, a French sculptor. The Romanian
                    sculptor, Gheorghe Leonida, was responsible for fashioning the face. Christ the Redeemer is 98 feet tall and has a
                    26-feet tall pedestal. Its arms stretch 92 feet wide. The 635 metric ton statue, made of soapstone and concrete, is
                    located atop the 2,300 feet tall Corcovado mountain. The construction of the statue was initiated in 1922 and completed
                    by 1931.

                    Christ the Redeemer, or Cristo Redentor in Portuguese, offers beautiful views over the city, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the
                    bay, particularly at sunset. You can take a cog train, taxi, or van up Mount Corcovado or hike to the statue from Parque
                    Lage in the Jardim Botânico neighborhood. The train runs daily from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM, and tickets must be purchased in
                    advance. Prices vary between the low season (May-September) and high season (December-April), but expect to pay around
                    $15-20 for an adult ticket.

                <p>
                    Petra, a Jordanian wonder, is also listed among the seven wonders of the world. It has immense archaeological,
                    historical, and architectural value that makes it a jaw-dropping tourist attraction. The water conduit system and the
                    rock-cut architecture are the two most notable features of this ancient city. Petra is also nicknamed as the “Rose City”
                    due to the stone color from which it is carved. Petra is not only one seven wonders of the world but is also a UNESCO
                    World Heritage Site. It is also listed as one of the "28 Places to See Before You Die” by the Smithsonian magazine.

                    To access it, you have to walk about 15 minutes through a narrow canyon called the Siq. Exiting the narrow passage,
                    you’re greeted by one of the greatest sights on Earth: the Treasury. Carved into the rock face, it’s enormous and
                    overwhelming, and the sandstone is a kaleidoscope of pinks, oranges, and reds. The colors turn bolder and bolder at
                    sunset, setting the city on fire — not just the Treasury but the whole city, which was forgotten until a Swiss explorer
                    rediscovered it in 1812.
