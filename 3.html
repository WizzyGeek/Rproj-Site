                <p>
                    Chichen Itza is an archaeological site located in Mexico’s Yucatán State. It is a pre-Columbian city that was built
                    during the Terminal Classic period by the Maya people. The historical value of the site contributes to its status as a
                    wonder of the world. Chichen Itza is believed to have been one of the major cities of the ancient Mayan world and
                    constructions in the city exhibit a variety of architectural styles.

                    The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid ruins of Chichen Itza. This powerful city, a
                    trading center for cloth, slaves, honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted as the political
                    and economic hub of the Mayan civilization. The most familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated
                    astronomical observatory.

                <p>
                    The dream destination of millions of people across the world, Machu Picchu is one of the seven wonders of the world. It
                    is located in the Cusco Region of Peru’s Machupicchu District. According to the majority of archaeologists, the Inca
                    emperor Pachacuti built Machu Picchu as an estate around the year 1450. The site developed as a city but was abandoned a
                    century later during the Spanish Conquest. The site remained largely unknown to the rest of the world until its
                    discovery by the American explorer Hiram Bingham. Machu Picchu is a great representation of the Incan way of life.
