                <p>
                    The Great Wall of China, a global tourist hotspot, is known across the world for its uniqueness, great length, and
                    historical value. It is also considered to be one of the seven wonders of the world. The Great Wall of China is
                    associated with thousands of years of Chinese history. A series of walls were initially built by Chinese empires and
                    states over a period of many years, beginning as early as the 7th century BCE. These walls were then joined together to
                    result in the Great Wall of China. UNESCO inscribed the site as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.

                    The Great Wall of China is a popular day trip from Beijing, with the restored Badaling and Mutianyu sections only 1.5
                    hours away and accessible by car or bus. Both are outfitted with cable cars to save visitors a steep trek up, making
                    them good options for most travelers. Wild, unrestored sections like Jiankou, about two and a half hours from Beijing,
                    attract more experienced hikers and may require a tour guide. Tickets to the Great Wall cost about $6.50, plus another
                    $17.50 or so for the round-trip cable car ride.

                <p>
                    Although the Great Pyramid of Giza was not officially selected as one of the seven wonders of the world, it was assigned
                    an honorary title because of its undeniable importance. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest and the oldest one
                    among the three pyramids forming the Giza Pyramid Complex. Egyptologists believe that this pyramid was built over a
                    period of 10 to 20 years and completed by around 2560 BC. For over 3,800 years, the Great Pyramid of Giza stood tall as
                    the worldâ€™s tallest structure until this position was replaced by the skyscrapers of the modern world. The Pyramid has
                    baffled engineers and architects across the world as to how it was constructed in times when modern infrastructural
                    facilities did not exist. The pyramid houses the tomb of Khufu, the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh.
