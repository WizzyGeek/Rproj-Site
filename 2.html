                <p>   
                    The Taj Mahal is well known across the world for its historical value, its tale of love, and its stunning beauty. The
                    Taj Mahal is located in the historic Indian city of Agra. It houses the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of the Mughal
                    Emperor Shah Jahan. It is said that the Emperor loved his wife dearly and was prompted to build the Taj Mahal after her
                    death as a testament to his love. The construction of the Taj Mahal was completed by 1632. The construction of the
                    temple cost the equivalent of US$827 million today. In 1983, the Taj Mahal was inscribed by the UNESCO as a World
                    Heritage Site. Today, it attracts 7 to 8 million annual visitors each year.

                    The Taj Mahal is a labor of love. Emperor Shah Jahan built it in honor of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who bore 14
                    children but died in labor. Jahan was lost without her, and in 1631, he began construction on what is probably the
                    world’s most elaborate and expensive mausoleum (though the tomb itself is unadorned per Muslim law). Construction
                    required a rumored some 20,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants, who hauled marble from all over the region. The Taj is
                    famously symmetrical, which is part of why it’s so beautiful to look at and photograph. It you go, go for sunrise before
                    it gets overwhelmed with visitors.

                <p>
                    Rome, Italy hosts the Colosseum, which is one of the world's seven wonders. Sometimes called the Flavian Amphitheatre,
                    the Colosseum is an oval-shaped amphitheater in the center of the city. Constructed from concrete and sand, it is the
                    largest amphitheater in the world. The Colosseum's construction was initiated in AD 72 by Emperor Vespasian and was
                    finished by AD 80 by his successor, Titus. Domitian, another emperor of the Flavian dynasty later made certain
                    modifications to the amphitheater. The Colosseum had the capacity to host about 80,000 spectators. Mock sea battles,
                    animal hunts, famous battle re-enactments, executions, and mythological dramas were just some of the public spectacles
                    held at the Colosseum. Today, this wonder of the world is a popular tourist attraction and serves as the iconic symbol
                    of Imperial Rome.

                    The Colosseum is open from 8:30 AM to an hour before sunset every day. Standard admission is about $13 and allows access
                    to the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill. Tickets can be purchased on site, but there’s a good chance the line
                    will be unbearably long. Consider buying a Roma Pass from a tourist office for free entry to your first two stops in the
                    city, discounts on visits to subsequent attractions, and free transportation. Passholders can make a reservation at the
                    Colosseum for a $2 fee and skip the line altogether.
