                <p>   
                    History gives sanctity to only one list of seven wonders the one compiled in 200 BC by the Greek mathematics Philon of
                    Byzantium. The monuments that featured in the ancient list were the Colossus of Rhodes the pharos at Alexandria, The
                    Hanging Gardens of Babylon the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Mausoleum of Mausolus at
                    Halicarnassus and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. The Taj Mahal does not figure in it because obviously it did not exist
                    then,
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tradition of Seven Wonders has inspired succeeding generations to compile countless lists sice the Alexandrian era.
                    The Seven Wonders of the Middle ages were the Colosseum of Rome the Catacombs of Alexzandria the Great Wall of CHina,
                    the Stonehenge the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, China, the leaning Tower of Pisa , Italy, and the Hagia Sopia of
                    Constantinople.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new seven wonders project kicked off in 2001 by the swiss adventure Bernard Weber, rectifies a problem with the old
                    list. Actually the Greek writers were limited by their borders and could not have seen what else was going on around the
                    world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later there was global movement to choose the new seven wonders of the world by structured international polling. It was
                    initiated by the swiss entrepreneur Bernard Weber. The polling was open to all prince or pauper across the world. The
                    campaign made it mandatory that the structures must be manmade and be in sufficient state of preservation.
